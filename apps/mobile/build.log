[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] ✖ Check Expo config (app.json/ app.config.js) schema
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Error validating asset fields in /private/var/folders/33/xjdj0lnj18l9k1zh14jmvrd00000gn/T/eas-build-local-nodejs/9dc1cb80-efe9-40ca-b60f-9aedac1dad4b/build/apps/mobile/app.json:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]  Field: icon - the file extension should match the content, but the file extension is .png while the file content at './assets/icon.png' is of type jpg.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]  Field: icon - field 'icon' should point to .png image but the file at './assets/icon.png' has type jpg.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Advice:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Resolve schema errors in your app config. Learn more: https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/configuration/
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] ✖ Check for issues with Metro config
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] - "watchFolders" does not contain all entries from Expo's defaults
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] - "resolver.disableHierarchicalLookup" mismatch. Expected false, got: true
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Advice:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Modifying the "metro.config.js" is dangerous and may lead to unintended consequences.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Unless you know what these overrides do, remove them and adopt the recommended values from "expo/metro-config".
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] ✖ Check that native modules use compatible support package versions for installed Expo SDK
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Expected package @expo/config-plugins@~9.0.0
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Found invalid:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   @expo/config-plugins@2.0.4
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   (for more info, run: npm why @expo/config-plugins)
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Advice:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Upgrade dependencies that are using the invalid package versions.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] ✖ Validate packages against React Native Directory package metadata
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] The following issues were found when validating your dependencies against React Native Directory:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   Unmaintained: expo-av
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   No metadata available: @scatty/shared, socket.io-client
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Advice:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Use libraries that are actively maintained and support the New Architecture. Find alternative libraries with https://reactnative.directory.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Add packages to expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.exclude in package.json to selectively skip validations, if the warning is not relevant.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Update React Native Directory to include metadata for unknown packages. Alternatively, set expo.doctor.reactNativeDirectoryCheck.listUnknownPackages in package.json to false to skip warnings about packages with no metadata, if the warning is not relevant.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] ✖ Check that packages match versions required by installed Expo SDK
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   @expo/metro-runtime@6.1.2 - expected version: ~4.0.1
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   react-native@0.76.5 - expected version: 0.76.9
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   react-native-screens@4.1.0 - expected version: ~4.4.0
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR]   react-native-web@0.21.2 - expected version: ~0.19.13
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Your project may not work correctly until you install the expected versions of the packages.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Found outdated dependencies
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Advice:
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] Use 'npx expo install --check' to review and upgrade your dependencies.
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] To ignore specific packages, add them to "expo.install.exclude" in package.json. Learn more: https://expo.fyi/dependency-validation
[RUN_EXPO_DOCTOR] 5 checks failed, indicating possible issues with the project.
